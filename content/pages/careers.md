          The inspiration for this project came during the Christmas season of
          2024, when God placed a deep conviction on my heart to help a young
          man who was homeless. Initially, I hesitated at the thought of giving
          him £20, but the Holy Spirit gently but firmly convicted me, urging me
          to act in obedience. I committed to ensuring that, when I next saw
          him, I would give him that £20. However, God had far more in store
          than I could have ever imagined. Not only did I have the privilege of
          giving, but I also had the opportunity to minister to this young man,
          building a meaningful rapport and offering support in whatever way I
          could. This experience filled me with indescribable joy, knowing that
          through my obedience, I was able to serve God by helping someone in
          need and, most importantly, sharing the hope of Jesus with him. It was
          a powerful reminder of God's love and provision, and it ignited a
          passion within me to do more for others. To Him be all the glory for
          this journey. He is the true source of this mission, and it is only by
          His grace and guidance that I am able to step into this calling.

          In 2018, I travelled to Nigeria with AIPA Irelamd, stepping into
          villages where access to health care was scarce. As a 14 year old, I
          remember seeing the desperation in people's eyes as they pushed
          forward, forming long, restless queues to receive medication.  There
          was a deep urgency, unlike anything that I had ever seen before. It
          was in those moments that something deeper was planted in my heart —
          more than just a desire to help; but a call to serve. Years later,
          when I gave my life to Christ, the burden to serve my community grew
          stronger. The hope and joy I found in Him wasn't something I could
          keep to myself — I wanted to share it with those who were struggling,
          searching or feeling forgotten. And so, the Living Hope Project was
          born — not for my glory, but for His. This is His work, His mission,
          and I am simply a vessel. My prayer is that through this ministry,
          those who are lost, broken, or weary will find the same hope and joy
          that changed my life.
